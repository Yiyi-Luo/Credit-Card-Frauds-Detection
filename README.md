## About This Repository

The notebooks in the **main** branch are my personal notebooks, which include:

- **Introduction to the LightGBM Model**
- **Business Understanding**
- **Data Cleaning**
- **Data Exploration**
- **Modeling**
- **Evaluation**

If you wish to see the original blank instruction notebooks, please switch to the **instruction-notebooks** branch.

### Note on Hyperlinks

In the **Introduction to the LightGBM Model** notebook, hyperlinks may not function when viewed locally in Jupyter Notebook due to limitations with hyperlink support. To navigate using hyperlinks, open the notebook in **Jupyter Lab**. Jupyter Lab automatically generates a table of contents from the notebook headings, enabling functional and navigable hyperlinks.

### Datasets
